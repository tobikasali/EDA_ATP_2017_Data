Exploratory Data Analysis with R - ATP 2017 data

This is a Udacity project exploring data from the ATP tour in 2012. 

Tennis is one of my favorite sports and although i don’t play very well, I do watch some tennis matches. Roger Federer is my favorite player and he’s had a big resurgence this year which has got people wondering - Has he changed his game? What is he doing differently? I had been on Kaggle and seen the ATP dataset and I thought I’ll use this for my project. I picked the data from 2012 because I wanted one far enough for me to have forgotten what actually happened in that season. So who won the most matches that year? What are the factors that influence players winning matches? This report explores a dataset containing results for Tennis players on the ATP tour in 2012.
